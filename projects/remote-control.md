#### Context
Microelectronic circuits (EE 230) final lab project
#### Skills developed
Circuit design and evaluation; amplifier design; filter design; oscilloscope, multimeter, and power source operation
#### About 
Working as a team of two, we designed a remote controlled switch that operated two LEDs. We designed two oscillators to transmit at separate frequencies from one breadboard as the transmitter, controlled by a switch. On another breadboard, we had a photodetector receive the signal transmitted by the IR LED and had two branches of the circuit amplify and filter two separate frequency ranges to detect the source frequency and power a red or green LED, respectively.
