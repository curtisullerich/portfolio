I pride myself on my attention to detail and thoroughness in project completion. ISU has given me opportunities to develop several really fun and educational projects. I've also taken the time to create various project in my free time based on engineering, youth development, or my other interests. From here you can check out my various academic and personal projects. Use the drop down menus above for full details on some of my favorite projects.
