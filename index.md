## About Me

I am currently a senior in Computer Engineering with a minor in Music Technology at Iowa State University. This is my portfolio of accomplishments and projects as a student, intern, and active member of my community. Outside of my career as an engineer, I have a variety of passions. I am very involved in youth development through the 4-H program as president of ISU Collegiate 4-H and mentor on the Iowa 4-H Youth Tech Team. I am in the marching band, symphonic band, and organize a variety of community music performances throughout the year. I enjoy running, and have completed three half marathons. I am a fan of photography and have taken up the hobby on my own within the last year.
    
## Career Objective

I have learned from my classwork and internship experiences that I enjoy working in teams and solving problems. I believe in improving my community and the world around me, so I also strive to find a role in a company that benefits people. Simply put, I hope to work in a company developing software that directly benefits people or improves the quality of life of individuals or communities.

## Philosophy on Education

I see my time at Iowa State University as an opportunity. The academic priority of my time here is obvious, but further than that, I am taking the time to fully engage in leadership and citizenship through involvement in clubs and individual goals. My projects page provides tangible evidence of what I am doing. Before I complete my degree at Iowa State I aim to be fully equipped as a leader, a conscientious and engaged citizen, and, of course, a professionally prepared and valuable computer engineer.
