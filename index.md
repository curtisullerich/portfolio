## Welcome!

Hello! My name is Curtis Ullerich and I am currently a senior in Computer Engineering with a minor in Music Technology at Iowa State University. This is my portfolio of things that I love to do. Check out the pages in the navigation bar to read about my projects, qualifications, community involvement, and interests.

I mainly use the blog section of the site for posts about project updates or awesome things that excite me that aren't big enough for their own page.
