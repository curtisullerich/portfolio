## Welcome!

Hi! I'm a software engineer at Google and recent graduate of Iowa State University. This is my portfolio of things that I love to do. I originally started it as another way of letting employers et al get an idea of who I am. Over time it will transform into a more general repository of things I want to share with the world. Check out the pages in the navigation bar to read about who I am and what I do.

I mainly use the blog section of the site for posts about project updates or awesome things that excite me that aren't big enough for their own page. At least for now, I don't post to it very often.
