{% include JB/setup %}
I am running for the student seat on the IEEE-HKN Board of Governors. I am currently the president of HKN Nu Chapter at Iowa State University. I have been an active student member of IEEE-HKN since 2010, and had the pleasure of attending the 2013 Student Leadership Conference at Arizona State University. After holding local leadership positions, I want to take my HKN experience to the next step and benefit the program nationally and internationally. My IEEE-HKN biography below offers some basic background about me. The rest of this website details many other aspects of my life. If you or your chapter have questions about me or my platform, please don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact.html).

##Biography
Curtis Ullerich is working toward his B.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Music Technology from Iowa State University. He currently serves as the president of IEEE-HKN Nu Chapter at Iowa State University. Ullerich is helping to plan the IEEE-HKN Student Leadership Conference 2014 to be held at Iowa State University, hosted by Nu Chapter.  

Ullerich has interned at Telligen, Garmin, and Microsoft, recently focusing his work on the areas of machine learning and big data. He has held undergraduate research assistant positions in bioinformatics at ISU's Virtual Reality Applications Center and in static Android malware analysis on the DARPA APAC program. He currently works toward creating new musical experiences using software and technology. Following the completion of his degree, he will join Google as a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area.  

##Platform
If elected as Student Governor, I have three main priorities:
1. **Focus on inter-chapter and national-local communication.** Given the recent transition with IEEE and frequent changes resulting from this, I want to increase the effectiveness of communication with members from the national leadership and in turn promote efficient record keeping and feedback from chapters. I would also like to promote discussion between chapters on program development. Chapters around the country (and now world!) have many successes and struggles to share. I would like to explore platforms for hosting discussions and sharing ideas amongst members.  
2. **Encourage effective collaboration between HKN chapters and IEEE student chapters.** Chapters have a great opportunity for cooperative events and projects with their fellow IEEE members. Working together, members can expand their chapter activities and networking potential by working with their IEEE student chapters.  
3. **Challenge chapters to evaluate their standard operations to ensure quality progress and chapter development.** It is easy to continue the same old chapter activities from year to year. I want to challenge chapters to re-evaluate their annual events and projects so that their members and fellow students are engaged by relevant membership programming. This will go hand-in-hand with goals 1 and 2.  

##IEEE-HKN Accomplishments and Activities
As vice president of Nu Chapter, I worked with our cabinet to increase active membership and offer new, relevant programming to students in our department. Here are a few noteworthy accomplishments during my time on the executive board:  
- Created a semesterly mock technical interview program for students  
- Facilitated technical, hands-on seminars for students ('Lab Jams')  
- Initiated a 'Dessert and Discussions' program to encourage networking with faculty  
- Spearheaded the evaluation/revitalization of chapter programming and revamping of chapter policy  
- Defined effective record keeping and officer transition procedures  
- Participated in peer mentoring  
- Served as chair of the ECE department Student Advisory Committee
