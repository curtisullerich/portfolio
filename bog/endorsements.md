Here are a few endorsements for my candidacy for Student Governor by peers and mentors I respect and who know me well. For more information, view my [main candidacy page](/bog.html).  

###Dr. Timothy A. Bigelow  
*Nu Chapter Advisor*  
*Harpole-Pentair Assistant Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University*  
  
Over the years, I have had the privilege to work with many highly motivated students in HKN as the faculty advisor for the local chapters at the University of North Dakota and now as the faculty advisor at Iowa State University.  Curtis Ullerich is by far the most motivated HKN member that I have had  the privilege to work with.  He took the initiative to rewrite the chapters constitution so that it reflected current practices and procedures.  He has put his time and energy into the chapter making it run smoothly and improving the benefit to the students.  I have every confidence that he will work hard as the Student Governor to improve the organization for all student members.
  
###Joseph Groenenboom
*Software Engineer, IBM*  

While I was the president of the Nu chapter, I worked with Curtis for two years.  During that time he frequently displayed excellent leadership skills and great enthusiasm for Eta Kappa Nu.  His efforts enhanced our standing in the department as he added opportunities for all students to participate in events that prepared them for the professional world.  Inside the chapter Curtis also worked to define clear leadership roles for all of the executive positions with input from other members.  The culmination of these efforts was a more efficient and more active chapter that better served both its members and the other engineering students at Iowa State University.  Additionally, he has also been an active volunteer in the community, traveling to schools to introduce young students to engineering.  As a Student Governor, I know Curtis will work with the same enthusiasm and dedication as he has shown in the rest of his life.  Working with him as been a privilege that I hope the IEEE-HKN Board of Governors will also share.  
  
###Ryan Scheel
*Software Engineer, Garmin*  
*Senior, Iowa State University*  
  
I met Curtis Ullerich four years ago in the Iowa State University Honors Program. Since then I have worked with him on numerous projects throughout many different classes at ISU. Every project and organization in which he gets involved benefits directly from his intelligence, leadership, and high degree of work ethic.  

Most recently, he and I have been undertaking our senior design project since January of 2013. I firmly believe that if anyone else had taken his place on the team that our project would be months behind where it is now, both in terms of quality and completion.  

Curtis is far and away the best student I have had the pleasure of knowing during my time at ISU. I'm confident that he would make an exceptional IEEE-HKN Student Governor, and that the Board of Governors would be very glad to have him.
