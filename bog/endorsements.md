###Dr. Timothy A. Bigelow  
*Nu Chapter Advisor*  
*Harpole-Pentair Assistant Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University*  

Over the years, I have had the privilege to work with many highly motivated students in HKN as the faculty advisor for the local chapters at the University of North Dakota and now as the faculty advisor at Iowa State University.  Curtis Ullerich is by far the most motivated HKN member that I have had  the privilege to work with.  He took the initiative to rewrite the chapters constitution so that it reflected current practices and procedures.  He has put his time and energy into the chapter making it run smoothly and improving the benefit to the students.  I have every confidence that he will work hard as the Student Governor to improve the organization for all student members.
