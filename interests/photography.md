Photography is a personal passion and hobby of mine. I received my first camera for Christmas in 2010 (a Powershot SX130) just before my semester abroad in England. I took a formidable number of photos during that experience, and started a 365 project, in which I take one photo every day for a year. I have compiled the full results of that endeavor into [this album](/interests/365-project.html). Though class and traveling often made it very difficult to continue, I completed the project successfully on January 22nd, 2012. This was an excellent way to discover photography, learn about composition, and document my year. I currently use a Nikon D3100 as my primary camera. Check out a gallery of some of my photos below. All photos used on the website are my own, as well, unless specifically noted otherwise.
