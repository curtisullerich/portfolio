## One Photo, Every Day, For One Year

Inspired by my friend [Doug Auerbach](http://www.dougauerbach.com/), and very enthusiastic about my new camera, I set out to fill some of my new-found free time while studying abroad by completing a 365 project of my own. Starting on January 23rd, 2011, I took one photo every day for a year. I'm very happy with my results, though travelling and classes often made it difficult to complete, I stuck with it. This album encompasses my full experience abroad. Without doing such a project,
I know that I wouldn't have captured all the memories and fantastic experiences in such a permanent way. The full album is below. Since completing the project, Doug and I briefly ran a [weekly challenge](http://www.fictivefaction.com/).
