During winter break I have been learning about algorithmic composition using [RTcmix](http://www.rtcmix.org/) (with a Python front-end). Someone on their mailing list suggested Heinrich Taube's "Notes from the Metalevel" as an introductory text on the subject. Because that book uses Lisp, I translated many of the examples into Python with RTcmix for sound generation. I implemented several functions from the Common Music API as well, most notably nth-order Markov chaining. You can see the code on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/curtisullerich/cmix).
