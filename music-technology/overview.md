You can use the drop down menu above to view some of my music tech projects.  

One of my primary academic interests is the cross-disciplinary study of music technology and software as it relates to music composition and performance. I have worked with Dr. Christopher Hopkins at Iowa State University in research and classroom settings to develop various tools for composition and performance, as well as exploring a variety of existing music software and concepts.  

Through the music technology minor program at ISU and my studies at the University of Birmingham electroacoustic studio, I have gained experience using ProTools, Sibelius, Max/MSP, Cubase, Audacity, and Kontakt (including kscript programming).  

I was featured in an Elks National Foundation article for my involvement in music technology as an ENF Scholar. You can read the article [here](http://www.elks.org/ENF/news.cfm?StoryID=76114) (I'm the second one).
