I am currently working on my capstone project for the Honors program at Iowa State University. Under the guidance of Christopher Hopkins in the Music department and Tien Nguyen of the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, I am experimenting with using scripting to modify haptic-enabled virtual reality environments. I am using the H3D API, X3D, and Python to design creative ways of interacting with 3D scenes for the purpose of electroacoustic music composition and performance.

This is one example of haptic interaction, in which I map the x, y, and z axes to three different musical parameters to create a sort of virtual theramin
