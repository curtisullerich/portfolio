This was my very first music technology project. Using a single sample of a "pop" sound just 800 milliseconds long, I created a full single-timbred sampling instrument reminiscent of a marimba. Using Audacity, I cleaned up the sample and pitch shifted to a full three-octave set of notes.

I wrote a simple composition based around the mixolydian scale to display it. All tracking was done using quantization in Pro Tools.

Listen to the piece, called "Cliche."
