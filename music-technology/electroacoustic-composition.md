While at the University of Birmingham, England, during my semester [abroad](/abroad/), I had the opportunity to study electroacoustic composition with Jonty Harrison and Annie Mahtani. Brum, as it's known colloquially, has an excellent post-grad program in electroacoustic music and an impressive [sound theatre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_ElectroAcoustic_Sound_Theatre). I took eight credit-hours of composition: Three in a seminar setting and five in a small-group independent study with two final year music students.  

Electroacoustic music is the art form that takes ambient, usually recorded sounds and modifies them  electronically to introduce musical gesture and form. This experience was a great addition to my music technology minor.  

Below are my two final projects, "Etude" and "Chimeric Devotion" from my seminar and independent study courses, respectively.
