## About Me
I currently work as a software engineer at Google, volunteer with 4-H, and make music whenever I get the chance. In 2013 I graduated in Computer Engineering with a minor in Music Technology from Iowa State University. This is my portfolio of accomplishments and projects as a student, intern, and active member of my community. I enjoy photography, running, sign language, and swing dancing, among other things.

## Career Objective
I have learned from my classwork and engineering experiences that I enjoy working in teams and solving problems. I believe in improving my community and the world around me, so I also strive to find a role in a company that benefits people. Simply put, I hope to always work in a company developing software that benefits people or improves the quality of life of individuals or communities while tackling difficult engineering problems. Though my interests continue to develop, the motivation behind why I do what I do stays the same.

## Philosophy on Education
As an undergraduate, I saw my time at Iowa State University as an opportunity. The academic priority of my time there was obvious, but further than that, I tried to take the time to fully engage in leadership and citizenship through clubs and personal goals. My projects page demonstrates some of what I have done. As a student, I invested myself fully to become equipped as a leader, a conscientious and engaged citizen, and, of course, a professionally prepared and valuable computer engineer.
